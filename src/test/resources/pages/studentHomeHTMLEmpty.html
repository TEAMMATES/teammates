        Welcome stranger :-)
        <br>
        <br>
        It seems you are not a registered user of TEAMMATES. To use TEAMMATES, a course instructor has to add you to a course first. After that, TEAMMATES will send you an email containing the link to 'join' that course.
        <br>
        <br>
        Not a stranger to TEAMMATES? Could log in before, but not any more? These are the possible reasons:
        <br>
        1. You used a different Google account to access TEAMMATES in the past. In that case, you need to use the same Google account to access TEAMMATES again. Logout and re-login using the other Google account. If you don't remember which Google account you used previously, email us from the same email account to which you receive TEAMMATES emails.
        <br>
        2. You changed the primary email from a non-Gmail address to a Gmail address recently. In that case,
        <a href="/contact.jsp">
          email us
        </a>
        so that we can reconfigure your account to use the new Gmail address.
        <br>
        3. You joined this course just a few seconds ago and your data may be still in the process of propagating through our servers. In that case, please click on the
        <a href="/page/studentHomePage">

        </a>
        link above in a few minutes.
