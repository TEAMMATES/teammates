            When you view the results of a multiple-choice (single answer) question, TEAMMATES calculates some statistics about the results collected,
            such as the number of responses for each option, and the percentage of response in which each option was chosen.
            If weights are assigned in the question, then additional statistics are calculated such as count and average point for each option.
            'Per Recipient Statistics' are calculated if weights are assigned, it contains the number of responses each recipient received for each option,
            and the total and average points for each recipient.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Note: </strong> Weights can be assigned for questions with existing questions too. To do that, edit the question that needs weights,
            if there are existing responses for that question, the additional statistics will automatically get calculated for the question.

            Team contribution questions are a specialized question type designed to evaluate a student's level of contribution in a team.<br>
            They estimate the perceived contribution of a student and prevent students from inflating their own scores.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you do not wish to use TEAMMATES's specialized calculation scheme, you may choose to use a distribute points (among recipients) question type.
            Distribute points (among recipients) questions calculate the mean of all scores given to the recipient.

          <p>

          </ol>
          <p>
            The feedback path for this question type is fixed: the feedback giver must be a student, and the student must give feedback about his/her team members and himself.

          <p>
            Contribution questions in TEAMMATES are unique because they are targeted at measuring team contributions. <br>
            Thus, TEAMMATES purposefully prevents students from influencing their own ‘perceived contribution’ value.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perceived contribution is calculated based on what a student's other team members perceive as his/her contribution.
            The student's own opinion about his own contribution is not considered for the calculation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Students enter contribution estimates for self and team members, using the scale <code>Equal share + x%</code>. e.g. <code>Equal share -10%</code><br>
            Based on those values, we try to deduce the student's answer to the following two questions:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              In your opinion, what proportion of the project did you do?
            </li>
            <li>
              In your opinion, if your teammates were doing the project by themselves without you, how would they compare against each other in terms of contribution?
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            In the calculation, we do not allow (1) to affect (2). We use (2) to calculate the average perceived contribution for each student. A more detailed version of this calculation can be found
            <a (click)="openContribInfoModal()" [routerLink]="">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The results and statistics are presented in the example below. Here is a summary of the terms used:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>E (Equal share)</b>: a relative measure of work done. e.g. For a 3-person team, an ‘Equal share’ means ‘a third of the total work done’.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b >CC (Claimed Contribution)</b>: This is what the student claimed he contributed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Ratings Received </b>: These are the peer opinions as to how much the student contributed. These values have been adjusted to neutralize any attempts by students to boost their own standing by rating others low.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>PC (Perceived Contribution)</b>: This is the average value of the ‘Ratings Received’. This can be considered as the
              <i>team’s perception of how much the student contributed</i>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Diff</b>: The difference between the claimed contribution (CC) and the perceived contribution (PC). This value can be used to identify those who have over/under-estimated their own contribution.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The ratings in a contribution question can be used to identify relative contribution levels of students in a team.
            If you use these values for grading, also refer the ‘Interpret contribution numbers with care’ caveat in the
            <button class="btn btn-link" (click)="collapsePeerEvalTips.emit()">tips for conducting 'team peer evaluation' sessions</button> section.
          </p>
          <p>
            The actual contribution values entered by the student may appear different from the values shown in the results because the system ‘normalizes’ those values so that there is no artificial inflation of contribution.
            For example, if a student says everyone contributed ‘Equal share + 10%’, the system automatically normalizes it to ‘Equal share’ because in reality that is what the student means.
            ‘Normalize’ here means scale up/down the values so that the <code>(sum of contributions) = ( n x Equal Share)</code> where <code>n</code> is the number of students being reviewed.

            Rubric questions allow instructors to create multiple sub-questions with highly customizable choices and descriptions.
          </p>
          <p>
            To respondents, a rubric question will appear as a table that looks similar to the example below. Respondents can choose one answer per row.

            </li>
            <li>
              Add subquestions using the <code>Add Row</code> button, or delete subquestions using the <code>x</code> button to the left of each subquestion

            Result statistics for rubric questions show how often a choice is selected for each sub-question.<br>
            If weights are assigned to the choices, the weights will be used to calculate an average score.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Response Summary Table:</strong> Each choice cell of each sub-question in the Response summary table
            has three parts <strong>Percentage (Response count) [Weight of the choice]</strong>. Each of the parts are explained below:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Percentage: Shows the percentage of how often this choice is selected out of all responses for this sub-question.
            </li>
            <li>
              Response count: Shows the number of times this choice is selected
            </li>
            <li>
              Weight of the choice: Shows the weight attached with this choice of this sub-question.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If weights are assigned to the question, then based on the weight of each choice and the response count of that choice,
            the overall average score of the sub-question is calculated.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Per Recipient Statistics:</strong> This table is only shown to the questions which have weights assigned.
            Similar to the Response summary table, each choice of each sub-question in this table is divided into two parts,
            which are <strong>Response Count [Weight of the choice]</strong>. Based on the weight assigned to the choice and
            the response count of that choice, total and average points for the sub-question is calculated for each recipient.
