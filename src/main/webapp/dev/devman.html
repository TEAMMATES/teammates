    <h1 id="project">Project</h1>

    <h2 id="project-vision">Vision</h2>

    Long term goal: Become the
    <span class="bold">biggest student project in the world</span>.
    <br> {Biggest = many contributors, many users, relatively large
    code base (50k-100k LoC), evolving over a long period.}
    <br> 'Biggest' above also implies an exceptionally high quality
    standard because high quality is a necessity for the long-term survival
    of a big student project.
    <br>
    <br> This project will also serve as
    <span class="bold"> a model and a training ground for Software
        Engineering students </span> who want to learn SE skills in the
    context of a non-trivial real software product.
    <br>

    <h2 id="project-challenges">Challenges</h2>
    The project differs from typical student projects in the following
    areas, which makes it more challenging and the experience more
    enriching.
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="bold">Developers</span>: All developers are
            novices and their involvement with the project is short term and part
            time.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Code</span>: Working with legacy code
            written by past developers is harder than writing from scratch.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Data</span>: The data in the live system
            are confidential and developers are not allowed to see them. This
            makes troubleshooting harder.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Releases</span>: Frequent releases to an
            active user database requires us to maintain 'production quality'
            constantly.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Platform</span>: TEAMMATES is running on
            Google App Engine cloud platform, which adds the following
            challenges.
            <ul>
                <li>It is an emerging platform evolving rapidly. We have to
                    keep up.</li>
                <li>It imposes various restrictions on the application. e.g.
                    Each request to the app has to be served within 60 seconds.</li>
                <li>It charges us based on usage. We have to optimize usage.</li>
            </ul></li>
        <li><span class="bold">Software Engineering</span>: As TEAMMATES
            serve as a model system for training students, it should also focus
            on applying good SE techniques.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="project-principles">Principles</h2>
    We apply these principles to meet the challenges stated above.
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="bold">We keep moving forward, always</span>: We
            release frequently, in weekly <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing">time-boxed
                iterations</a>. Every week, our product becomes better than the previous
            week. This means 'go back and rewrite from scratch' is only a last
            resort.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">We are agile</span>: We are able to change
            the system quickly and easily to match emerging requirements. We
            aim for minimal yet sufficient documentation.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">We defend our code with tests,
                fiercely</span>: Since we practice <a
            href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/collective.html">collective
                code ownership</a>, we have to make sure the code is not accidentally
            broken by others. We use fully automated regression testing. The
            testing automation level of this project is probably higher than 99%
            of the projects out there.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">We are 'Gods' of the few tools we
                use</span>: We stick to a minimal toolset. Adding third-party tools and
            libraries to the project is done only if there is a STRONG
            justification. Only mature, stable, and well-supported tools are
            considered. Once selected, we should know the tool very well to get
            the best out of it.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">We value quality more than
                functionality</span>: Our job is not to 'anyhow get it to work'. The
            system should be good enough to be considered a 'model' software. Our
            code should be of 'unusually' high quality: All code is reviewed before
            accepting.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">We know what we are doing</span>: For us,
            it is not enough to know something is broken, we should also know why
            it is broken. It is not enough to get something working, we should
            know how we got it to work.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">We seek the best, not stop at the
                first</span>: We do not settle for the first workable method to solve a
            problem. We study other ways of solving it and decide what is the
            best way for us.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">We take pains to save the team from
                pain</span>: Whenever we had to spend effort in figuring out something, we
            refine code/documents so that others don't have to go through the
            same pain. Whenever we figured out a less painful way of doing
            something, we make sure everyone in the team learn it too.</li>
    </ul>

    <br> TEAMMATES is a Web app that runs on Google App Engine (GAE)
    cloud platform. Given above is an overview of the main components.
    <br>

    <ul>
        <li><span class="bold">UI</span>: The UI seen by users consists
            of Web pages containing HTML, CSS (for styling) and JavaScripts (for
            client-side interactions such as sorting, input validation etc.).
            This UI is generated by Java Server Pages (JSP) and Java Servlets
            residing on the server. Requests are sent to the server over normal
            HTTP. In future, AJAX may be used sparingly to fetch data from the
            server asynchronously.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Logic</span>: The main logic of the app is
            in Java POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects). Some automated tasks are
            implemented as Servlets.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Storage</span>: Storage uses the
            persistence framework provided by GAE 'datastore', a noSQL database.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Test Driver</span>: TEAMMATES makes heavy
            use of automated regression testing. TestNG is used for Java unit
            testing and QUnit for JavaScript unit testing. We use Selenium Web
            Driver to automate UI testing. Test Driver can access the application
            directly to set up test data. We use JSON format to transmit such
            data to the application.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Client</span>: The Client component can
            connect to the back end directly without using a Browser. It is used
            for administrative purposes. e.g., migrating data to a new schema</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Common</span>: The Common component
            contains utility code used across the application.</li>
    </ul>
    The diagram below shows how the code is organized into packages inside
    each component and dependencies among them.
    <div class="image-holder">
        <img class="image" src="images/packageDiagram.png" width="90%" />
    </div>
    <br> Notes:
    <ul>
        <li>[logic] - [ui::view] - [ui::controller] represent an
            application of Model-View-Controller pattern.</li>
        <li>ui::view and ui::website packages are not Java packages. They
            consist of jsp, html, js and css files.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2 id="design-ui">UI</h2>
    The diagram below shows the object structure of the UI component.
    <div class="image-holder">
        <img class="image" src="images/UiComponent.png" width="90%" />
    </div>
    <br>

    <h3>Request flow</h3>
    Request from the Browser for a specific page will go through following steps:
    <br></br>

    <div class="image-holder">
        <img src="images/UiWorkflow.png" width="100%"></img>
    </div>

    <ol>
        <li>Request received by the GAE server.</li>
        <li>Custom filters are applied according to the order
            specified in <span class="code">web.xml</span>. In our case this
            would be <span class="code">DatastoreFilter</span> and <span
            class="code">LoginFilter</span>. For example, the <span class="code">LoginFilter</span>
            will forward any request from not-logged-in users to the login page.
            If the request is from logged in user, then it will proceed according
            to the URL. e.g. <span class="code">/page/instructorHomePage</span>
        </li>
        <li>Request forwarded to the <span class="code">ControllerServlet</span>.
        </li>
        <li><span class="code">ControllerServlet</span> uses the <span
            class="code">ActionFactory</span> to generate the matching <span
            class="code">Action</span> object. E.g., <span class="code">InstructorHomePageAction</span>.
        </li>
        <li><span class="code">ControllerServlet</span> executes the
            action.</li>
        <li>The <span class="code">Action</span> object checks the access
            rights of the user. If the action is allowed, it interacts with the <span
            class="code">Logic</span> component to perform the action.
        </li>
        <li>Assuming the action was loading a page, the <span
            class="code">Action</span> gathers the data required for the page
            into a <span class="code">PageData</span> object. e.g. <span
            class="code">InstructorHomePageData</span>, creates a <span
            class="code">ShowPageResult</span> object by encolosing the <span
            class="code">PageData</span> object created previously, and returns
            it to the <span class="code">ControllerServlet</span>
        </li>
        <li><span class="code">ControllerServlert</span> "sends" the
            result. In the case of a <span class="code">ShowPageResult</span>,
            this is equivalent to forwarding to the matching JSP page.</li>
        <li>The JSP page uses the data in the given <span class="code">PageData</span>
            object to generate the HTML page.
        </li>
        <li>The response will then be sent back to the Browser, which
            will render the page.</li>
    </ol>

    Things to note:
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>After performing certain actions, the Browser should load
            another page, possibly with the status of the previous action. For
            example, if the action is 'delete course', the Browser should load
            the 'courses' page after the server performed the action. In such
            cases, the result generated for the action will be of type <span
            class="code">RedirectResult</span> which simply instructs the Browser
            to send a fresh request for the specified page. In such cases, we do
            not create a <span class="code">PageData</span> object for the
            original request.<br> Example:
            <ul>
                <li>Browser request for 'delete course' action.</li>
                <li>Server performs the action (creates a <span class="code">RedirectResult</span>
                    object but no <span class="code">PageData</span> object) and
                    instructs the Browser to load the 'courses' page.
                </li>
                <li>As instructed, the Browser requests for the 'courses' page.
                </li>
                <li>Server processes the request separately (creates a <span
                    class="code">ShowPageResult</span> object but and a <span
                    class="code">PageData</span> object) and returns the 'courses' page.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The result of some actions is downloading of a file (e.g. an
            evaluation report). In such cases, the result type will be <span
            class="code">FileDownloadResult</span> and no <span class="code">PageData</span>
            object will be generated.
        </li>
        <li>Since the high-level workflow of processing a request is same
            for any request, we use the , the <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern">Template
                Method pattern</a> to abstract the process folow into the <span
            class="code">Action</span> class.
        </li>
        <li>The list of actions and corresponding URIs are listed in the
            <span class="code">ActionURIs</span> nested class of the <a
            href="https://code.google.com/p/teammatespes/source/browse/src/main/java/teammates/common/util/Const.java"
            target="_blank"><span class="code">Const</span></a> class.
        </li>
        <li>The list of pages and corresponding URIs are listed in the
            <span class="code">ViewURIs</span> nested class of the <a
            href="https://code.google.com/p/teammatespes/source/browse/src/main/java/teammates/common/util/Const.java"
            target="_blank"><span class="code">Const</span></a> class.
        </li>
    </ul>



    <h3>Types of pages</h3>
    The UI consist of following pages:
    <ul>
        <li>Product pages (functional): e.g., 'courses' page. These require login.</li>
        <li>Product pages (peripheral): e.g., help pages, error pages. etc.</li>
        <li>Website pages: These are the static pages of the product website. e.g., <span class="code">contact.html</span></li>
        <li>Project pages: Pages meant for developers, such as this page.
    </ul>

    <h2 id="design-logic">Logic</h2>

    The
    <span class="code">Logic</span> component handles the business logic of
    TEAMMATES.
    <br> It is accessible via a thin
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern">facade class</a>
    called
    <a
        href="https://code.google.com/p/teammatespes/source/browse/src/main/java/teammates/logic/api/Logic.java"
        target="_blank"><span class="code">Logic</span></a> which makes use of
    several
    <span class="code">*Logic</span> classes to handle the logic related to
    various types of data and to access data from the
    <span class="code">Storage</span> component. In particular, Logic is
    responsible for these:
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Managing relationships between entities. e.g., cascade logic
            for create/update/delete.</li>
        <li>Managing transactions. e.g., to ensure atomicity of a
            transaction.</li>
        <li>Sanitizing input values recevied from the UI component.</li>
        <li>Providing a mechanims for checking access control rights.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="image-holder">
        <img src="images/LogicComponent.png" width="90%" />
    </div>
    <br>

    Package overiew:
    <ul>
        <li><span class="code bold">logic.api</span>: Provides the normal API of the component.</li>
        <li><span class="code bold">logic.backdoor</span>: Provides a mechanism for the test driver to access data.</li>
        <li><span class="code bold">logic.core</span>: Contains the core logic of the system.</li>
        <li><span class="code bold">logic.automated</span>: Contains the logic of automated tasks.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Logic API</h3>
    Represented by these classes:
    <ul>
        <li><span class="code">Logic</span>: For the use of the UI. <span
            class="code">Logic</span> class acts as a facade between UI
            (servlets) and the backend of the app.</li>
        <li><span class="code">GateKeeper</span>: For the use of the UI. To
            check the access rights of a user for a given action.</li>
        <li><span class="code">BackDoorLogic</span>: For the use of <span
            class="code">TestDriver</span> (via <span class="code">BackDoorServlet</span>)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Policies</h3>
    General:
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Null values should <span class="bold">not</span> be used as
            parameters to this API, except when following the KeepExisting policy
            (explained later).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <br>Access control:
    <ul>
        <li>Although this component provides methods to perform access control,
        it API itself is not access controlled. The UI is expected to check access
        control (using <span class="code">GateKeeper</span> class) before calling a method in the <span class="code">Logic</span>.
        <li>However, calls received by <span class="code">BackDoorServlet</span>
            are authenticated using the 'backdoor key'. Backdoor key is a string
            known only to the person who deployed the app (typically, the
            administrator).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>API for creating entities:
    <ul>
        <li>Null parameters: Causes an assertion failure.</li>
        <li>Invalid parameters: Throws <span class="code">InvalidParametersException</span>.</li>
        <li>Entity already exists: Throws <span class="code">EntityAlreadyExists</span>
            exception (escalated from <span class="code">Storage</span> level).
        </li>
        <li>When creating <span class="code">Evaluations</span>, <span
            class="code">Submission</span> entities are automatically created at
            the time of creating an evaluation or changing the team structure of
            a course.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>API for retrieving entities:
    <ul>
        <li>Attempting to retrieve objects using <span class="code">null</span>
            parameters: Causes an assertion failure.
        </li>
        <li>Entity not found: <br> -Returns <span class="code">null</span>
            if the target entity not found. This way, read operations can be used
            easily for checking the existence of an entity.<br> -Throws <span
            class="code">EntityDoesNotExistsExeption</span> if a parent entity
            of a target entity is not found e.g., trying to list students of a
            non-existent course.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>API for updating entities:
    <ul>
        <li>Primary keys cannot be edited except: <span class="code">Student.email.</span>
        </li>
        <li>KeepExistingPolicy: the new value of an optional attribute is
            specified as <span class="code">null</span> or set to
            “Uninitialized”, the existing value will prevail. {This is not a good
            policy. To be reconsidered}.
        </li>
        <li><span class="code">Null</span> parameters: Throws an
            assertion error if that parameter cannot be null. Optional attributes
            follow KeepExistingPolicy.</li>
        <li>Entity not found: Throws <span class="code">EntityDoesNotExistException</span>
            exception.
        </li>
        <li>Invalid parameters: Throws <span class="code">InvalidParametersException.</span>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <br>API for deleting entities:
    <ul>
        <li><span class="code">Null</span> parameters: Not expected.
            Results in assertion failure.</li>
        <li>FailDeleteSilentlyPolicy: In general, delete operation do not
            throw exceptions if the target entity does not exist. Instead, it
            logs a warning. This is because if it does not exist, 
            it is as good as deleted.</li>
        <li>Cascade policy: When a parent entity is deleted, entities
            that have referential integrity with the deleted entity should also
            be deleted. <br> Refer to the API for the cascade logic.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="design-storage">Storage</h2>
    The
    <span class="code">Storage</span> component performs CRUD (Create,
    Read, Update, Delete) operations on data entities individually. 
    
    <div class="image-holder">
        <img src="images/StorageComponent.png" width=100% />
    </div>
    
    Package overiew:
    <ul>
        <li><span class="code bold">storage.api</span>: Provides the normal API of the component.</li>
        <li><span class="code bold">storage.entity</span>: Classes that represent persistable entities.</li>
        <li><span class="code bold">storage.datastore</span>: Classes for dealing with the datastore.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <br>Storage contains minimal logic beyond what is directly relevant to
    CRUD operations. <br> In particular, it handles these:
    <ul>
        <li>Validating data inside entities before creating/updating
            them, to ensure they are in a valid state.</li>
        <li>Hiding the complexities of datastore from the <span
            class="code">Logic</span> component. All GQL queries are to be
            contained inside the <span class="code">Storage</span> component.
        </li>
        <li>Protecting persitable objects: Classes in the <span
            class="code">storage::entity</span> package are not visible outside
            this component to prevent accidental modification to the entity's
            attributes (Since these classes have been marked as 'persistence
            capable', and changes to their attributes are automatically persisted
            to the datastore by default). <br> Instead, a corresponding
            non-persistent <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object">data
                transfer object</a> named <span class="code">*Attributes</span> (e.g., <span
            class="code">CourseAttributes</span> is the data transfer object for
            <span class="code">Course</span> entities) object is returned, where
            values can be modified easily without any impact on the persistent
            data copy. These datatransfer classes are in <span class="code">common::datatransfer</span>
            package explained later. Note: This decision was taken before GAE
            started supporting <a
            href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/datastore/jdo/creatinggettinganddeletingdata">
                the ability to 'detach' entities </a> to prevent accidental
            modifications to persistable data. The decision to use data transfer
            objects is to be reconsidered in the future.
        </li>
    </ul>
    The <span class="code">Storage</span> component will not perform any
    cascade delete/create operations.Cascade logic is currently handled by
    the <span class="code">Logic</span> component.
    <br>  

    
    <br> Note that the navigability of the association links between
    entity objects appear to be in the reverse direction of what we see in
    a normal OOP design. This is because we want to keep the data scheme
    flexible so that new entity types can be added later with minimal
    modifications to existing elements.

    <h3>Policies</h3>
    Add and Delete operations try to wait until data is persisted in the
    datastore before returning. This is not enough to compensate for
    eventual consistency involving multiple servers in the GAE production
    enviornment. However, it is expected to avoid test failures caused by
    eventual consistency in dev server and reduce such problems in the live server.
    <br> Note: 'Eventual consistency' here means it takes some time
    for a database operation to propagate across all serves of the Google's
    distributed datastore. As a result, the data may be in an inconsistent
    states for short periods of time although things should become
    consistent 'eventually'. For example, an object we deleted may appear
    to still exist for a short while.
    <br>
    <br> Implementation of Transaction Control has been decided
    against due to limitations of GAE environment and the nature of our
    data schema. Please see

    <ul>
        <li>If <span class="code">Null</span> is passed as a parameter,
            the corresponding value is <span class="bold">NOT</span> modified, as
            per the KeepExistingPolicy that was previously mentioned.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br> API for creating:
    <ul>
        <li>Attempt to create an entity that already exists: Throws <span
            class="code">EntityAlreadyExists</span> exception.
        </li>
        <li>Attempt to create an entity with invalid data: Throws <span
            class="code">InvalidParametersException</span></li>
    </ul>
    <br> API for retrieving:
    <ul>
        <li>Attempt to retrieve an entity that does not exist: Returns <span
            class="code">null</span>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br> API for updating:
    <ul>
        <li>Attempt to update an entity that does not exist: Throws <span
            class="code">EntityDoesNotExistException</span>.
        </li>
        <li>Attempt to update an entity with invalid data: Throws <span
            class="code">InvalidParametersException</span></li>
    </ul>
    <br> API for deleting:

        <li>Attempt to delete an entity that does not exist: Fails silently.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2 id="design-common">Common</h2>
    The Common component contains common utilities used across
    TEAMMATES.
    <br>
    <div class="image-holder">
        <img src="images/CommonComponent.png" width=90% />
    </div>

    Package overiew:
    <ul>
        <li><span class="code bold">common.util</span>: Contains utility
            classes.</li>
        <li><span class="code bold">common.exceptions</span>: Contains
            custom exceptions.</li>
        <li><span class="code bold">common.datatransfer</span>: Containts
            data transfer objects. Given below are some more information
            about this package.</li>
    </ul>
    <span class="code">common.datatransfer</span> package contains
    lightweight 'data transfer object' classes for transferring data among components. 
    They can be combined in various ways to transfer structured data between
    components. Given below are three examples.
    <br>
    <div class="image-holder">
        <img src="images/dataTransferClasses.png" width=90% />
    </div>
    <br> (a)
    <span class="code">Test Driver</span> can use the
    <span class="code">DataBundle</span> in this manner to send an
    arbitrary number of objects to be persisted in the database.
    <br> (b) This structure can be used to transfer data of a course
     (e.g., when constructing the home page for an
    instructor).
    <br> (c) This structure can be used to send results of an
    evaluation (e.g., when showing an evaluation report to an instructor)
    <br>
    <br> For convenience, these classes use public variables for data.
    This is not a good practice as it contravenes OO principle of
    <i>information hiding</i> and increases the risk of inconsistent data.
    This strategy is to be reconsidered at a later date.
    <br>


    <h2 id="design-testdriver">TestDriver</h2>
    This component automates the testing of TEAMMATES.
    <br>
    <div class="image-holder">

                    component.</li>
            </ul></li>
    </ul>
    Notes:
    <ul>
        <li>Component tests: Some of these are pure unit tests (i.e.,
            test one component in isolation) while others are integration tests
            that tests units as well as integration of units with each other.<br>
