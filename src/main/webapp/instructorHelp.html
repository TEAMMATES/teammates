				<ul>
					<li><b><a name="faq1" id="question">How do I view a list of students
								in a course?</a></b><br>Go to the ‘Courses’ page, click ‘View’ for
						the relevant course.<br> <br></li>
					<li><b><a name="faq2" id="question">How do I change student details
								after enrolling?</a></b><br>Choose to ‘Edit’ a student from the
						student list (see ‘How do I view a list of students in a course?’
						given above).<br> <br>Note: Moving a student to a
						different team (i.e. changing a students team id) will affect all
						existing sessions in that course. <br> <br></li>
					<li><b><a name="faq3" id="question">How do I add more students to a
								course?</a></b><br>You can use the ‘Enrol’ feature to add more
						students. If a student you are adding has the same email address
						as an existing student in the class, they will be considered the
						same student and the name, team name and the comment will be
						updated to the new values.<br> <br></li>
					<li><b><a name="faq4" id="question">How do I delete students from a
								course?</a></b><br>The ‘Delete’ link is available from the student
						list (see ‘How do I view a list of students in a course?’ given
						above).<br> <br></li>
					<li><b><a name="faq6" id="question">How do I change the Google ID
								associated with a student?</a></b><br>You can do that by editing
						student details (see ‘How do I change student details after
						enrolling?’ given above). But note that any data associated with
						the previous Google ID will not be visible to the student when he
						logs in using the new Google ID.<br> <br></li>
					<li><b><a name="faq7" id="question">What to do if a student says
								his/her courses have disappeared from the system?</a></b><br>The
						most likely reason for this is that the student has changed the
						primary email address associated with his/her Google ID. Please
						ask the student to email <a
						href="mailto:teammates@comp.nus.edu.sg">teammates@comp.nus.edu.sg</a>
						so that we help him to rectify the problem.<br> <br></li>
					<li><b><a name="faq7a" id="question">How do I
								interpret/use contribution values in evaluation reports?</a></b><br>
						<ul>
							<li><span class="bold gray">E (Equal share)</span> is a
								relative measure. e.g. For a 3-person team, an ‘Equal
								share’ means ‘a third of the total work done’.</li>
							<li><span class="bold gray">CC (Claimed Contribution)</span>
								: This is what the student claimed he contributed.</li>
							<li><span class="bold gray">Ratings Received </span>: These
								are the peer opinions as to how much the student contributed.
								These values have been adjusted to neutralize any attempts by
								students to boost their own standing by rating others low.</li>
							<li><span class="bold gray">PC (Perceived
									Contribution)</span>: This is the average value of the ‘Ratings
								Received’. This can be considered as the <span class="italic">team’s
									perception of how much the student contributed</span>.</li>
							<li><span class="bold gray">Diff</span> : The difference
								between the claimed contribution (CC) and the perceived
								contribution (PC). This value can be used to identify those who
								have over/under-estimated their own contribution.</li>
						</ul> <br> The above values can be used to identify relative
						contribution levels of students in a team. If you use these values
						for grading, also refer the ‘Interpret contribution numbers with
						care’ caveat in the <a href="#tips" class="toc">Tips for using
							the system</a> section below.<br> <br></li>

					<li><b><a name="faq8" id="question">What to do if a student says he
								cannot submit an evaluation due to some technical glitch?</a></b><br>You
						can ask the student to email his peer evaluation to you and then
						you can enter the details into the system using the ‘edit student
						submissions’ feature, as explained in the ‘Getting started’ guide
						above.<br> <br></li>
					<li><b><a name="faq9" id="question">How come the
								actual contribution values entered by the student is different
								from the values shown in the results?</a></b><br>This is because
						the system ‘normalizes’ those values so that there is no
						artificial inflation of contribution. For example, if a student
						says everyone contributed ‘Equal share + 10%’, the system
						automatically normalize it to ‘Equal share’ because in reality
						that is what the student means.<br>‘Normalize’ here means
						scale up/down the values so that the (sum of contributions) = (<span
						class="italic">n</span> x Equal Share) where <span class="italic">n</span>
						is the number of students being reviewed.<br> <br></li>
					<li><b><a name="faq10" id="question">Can a student influence his
								‘perceived contribution’ value by awarding himself a larger
								contribution?</a></b><br>No. The perceived contribution is
						calculated based on what his teammates perceive as his
						contribution. His own opinion about his own contribution is not
						considered for the calculation.</li><br>
					<li><b><a name="faq11" id="question">How are the contribution
								numbers calculated?</a></b><br>You can find the details of the
						contribution calculation scheme <a
						href="https://teammatesv4.appspot.com/dev/spec.html#supplementaryrequirements-pointcalculationscheme">here</a>.</li>

				<p>Any evaluation system has both positive and negative effects
					on those being evaluated. As teachers, you are probably keen to
					maximize the positive effect of this system on your course while
					minimizing any negative effects. Here are some of the things you
					could do:</p>
				<br> <br>

				<ul>
					<li><span id="question">Have frequent peer evaluations.<br></span>
						Rather than have only one peer evaluation at the end of the
						course, have several peer evaluations at different points of the
						course. This way, students get frequent peer-feedback about their
						contribution, giving them plenty of chances to correct their
						conduct as necessary.<br>
					<br></li>
					<li><span id="question">Ignore early peer evaluations.<br></span>Consider
						not using initial peer evaluations for grading. Let students know
						that in advance. This gives students time to get used to the
						system and be more relaxed in giving early feedback to peers.<br>
					<br></li>
					<li><span id="question">Interpret contribution numbers
							with care.<br>
					</span>Keep in mind the contribution numbers reported by TEAMMATES are
						based on student perceptions and may not reflect the real
						contribution of a student. Therefore, use those numbers primarily
						to identify cases that need further investigation.<br> You
						may ignore minor variations in the contribution numbers reported
						by TEAMMATES. The difference between [Equal share] and [Equal
						share - 2%] is not significant and can very well be due to
						rounding off within the system. <br> Keep in mind that it is
						human nature for one to downplay the value of contributions from
						others when one’s own contribution is being compared to that of
						others. As a result, it is common for the ‘perceived contribution’
						to be somewhat lower than what the student actually did. <br>
						When taking further actions based on evaluation reports, also pay
						attention to the team’s consensus level about the contribution of
						a student. For example, you can take further actions with more
						confidence if all team members rated a certain student’s
						contribution low.<br>
					<br></li>
					<li><span id="question">Tolerate unequal contributions.<br></span>This
						may be a good policy to adopt (If students know this policy, they
						will be more honest in reporting contribution values):<br>
					<br> <span class="italic">It is OK to do less than an
							equal share of the the work, as long as you are willing to accept
							a lower grade than your team members. It is your right to decide
							how much time you allocate to this course. How you prioritize
							your work is your own business.</span><br>
					<br></li>
					<li><span id="question">Announce a 'cooling off'
							period.<br>
					</span>This may be a good guidelines to give to students: <br>
					<br> <span class="italic">If you are unhappy about the
							peer-feedback received, please allow at least one day to lapse
							before you fire off a response email. You are likely to respond
							more rationally when you had some time to think it over. Also
							keep in mind that we do take note of how well you handle such a
							situation. You need to act professionally when facing conflicting
							views, opposition, and even deliberate sabotage.</span><br>
