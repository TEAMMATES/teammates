      Note that you need to join a course only once per course.<br>
      Also note that joining a course is optional. If you do not join, you can still submit feedback and view feedback responses using links sent to you by TEAMMATES.
      If you join, you get access to extra features such as the ability to see all your feedback sessions in a single home page.<br>

        <b>What should I do if I cannot see any/some of my courses I should be able to see in the system?</b>

      <div>
        These are the possible reasons:
        <ol>
          <li>
            You used a different Google account to access TEAMMATES in the past.
            In that case, you need to use the same Google account to access TEAMMATES again.
            Logout and re-login using the other Google account.
          </li>
          <li>
            You changed the primary email from a non-Gmail address to a Gmail address recently.
            In that case, email <a href="mailto:teammates@comp.nus.edu.sg">teammates@comp.nus.edu.sg</a> so that we can reconfigure your account to use the new Gmail address.
          </li>
        </ol>

    <li>
      <div>
        <b>What should I do if I'm unable to submit my responses?</b>
      </div>
      <div>
        Email <a href="mailto:teammates@comp.nus.edu.sg">us</a> so that we can help you submit.
        Note that we cannot do much if the submission deadline is over. It is not up to us (the TEAMMATES team) to accept overdue submissions.
