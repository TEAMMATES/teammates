# Performance Testing

TEAMMATES makes use of [JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/) for load and performance (L&P) testing, and uses the [JMeter Java API](https://jmeter.apache.org/api/index.html) and TestNG to automate the process of running performance tests.

The performance test cases are located in the [`teammates.lnp.cases`](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/tree/master/src/lnp/java/teammates/lnp/cases) package.

## Running Performance Tests

If you want to use your own copy of [JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi), update the `test.jmeter.*` properties in `src/lnp/resources/test.properties` accordingly.

First, open the terminal and navigate to the root of project folder. Start the backend server, i.e. `./gradlew serverRun`, before running the performance tests.

For more details about how to set up and run your local server, please refer to the [Development Guidelines](development.md).

### Using Gradle

In a new terminal, navigate to the root of project folder and run the following command:
```sh
./gradlew lnpTests
```

- The JMeter test results are stored as JTL files with the same name as the test file in `src/lnp/resources/results/<TEST_NAME>_<DATE>.jtl`. 
- A test statistics JSON file is generate alongside as `<TEST_NAME>Statistics_<DATE>.json`.

If the build fails:
- Check the console log messages to see if there were any errors or exceptions thrown. If so, take the necessary steps to fix them.
- Check the generated `.jtl` result files to see whether the `success` value of any row is `false` (Equivalent the 8th attribute of each row in the raw file). If so, investigate the cause (possibly by making use of the JMeter GUI and Listeners) and fix it.

### Using the Command Line

If you have JMeter installed, you can use `jmeter` in the command line to run tests and generate reports.

Execute this command after replacing the parameters with the relevant paths:
```sh
jmeter -n -t PATH_TO_TEST_FILE.jmx -l PATH_TO_RESULT_FILE.jtl -j PATH_TO_LOG_FILE.log
```

Also, you can use this command to generate a HTML **summary report** from the results file (`.jtl`) that was generated earlier:
```sh
jmeter -g PATH_TO_RESULT_FILE.jtl -o REPORT_OUTPUT_FOLDER -j PATH_TO_LOG_FILE.log
```

If you want to do both together (i.e. execute the test and generate the report), use:
```sh
jmeter -n -t PATH_TO_TEST_FILE.jmx -l PATH_TO_RESULT_FILE.jtl -e -o REPORT_OUTPUT_FOLDER -j PATH_TO_LOG_FILE.log
```

### Using JMeter GUI

You can also install JMeter and use its GUI to run performance tests. This is particularly useful when debugging or validating that the test works as expected.
However, you should not use the GUI to run large scale tests as it is very resource intensive.

Remember to **disable or remove all `Listeners`** in the `.jmx` file, unless you are debugging. Having them enabled can have a negative impact on the test performance.

## Creating Performance Tests

Each new test case must inherit the `BaseLNPTestCase` class, and implement the methods required for generating the test data and the JMeter L&P test plan. The L&P test plans are created in Java using the JMeter API.

The inherited test cases can run JMeter test by calling `runJmeter` method. When passing the parameter `shouldCreateJmxFile` as `true`, an equivalent `.jmx` file can be generated from this test plan.

To help with debugging, you can open this `.jmx` file in the JMeter GUI and add Listeners.

To see a sample implementation of a test case, you can refer to `FeedbackSessionSubmitLNPTest`. It is a _simple_ test case which load tests a PUT endpoint (`/webapi/responses`).
